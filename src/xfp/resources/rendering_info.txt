- The molecule fragment is drawn with the atoms in the same positions as in the original molecule.
- The central atom is highlighted in blue.
- Aromatic atoms are highlighted in yellow.
- Aliphatic ring atoms are highlighted in dark grey.
- Atoms/bonds that are drawn in light grey indicate pieces of the structure that influence the atoms' connectivity invariants but that are not directly part of the fingerprint.
